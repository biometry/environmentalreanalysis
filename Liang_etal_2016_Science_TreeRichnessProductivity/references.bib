  abstract =      {BackgroundTwo approaches mark the difference between
                   the “ecological” and “agricultural” view of
                   the biodiversity/growth relation. In ecology the
                   trend is averaged by taking monocultures of all
                   species as baseline to evaluate mixtures. This
                   contrasts the “agricultural” view focusing on the
                   most productive species or species combination as
                   baseline to evaluate mixtures. The present study
                   investigates the change of highest rates (maximum)
                   productivities in grasslands and forests with
                   increasing plant (or tree) diversity, and compares
                   these with the average response.MethodsWe base our
                   analysis on existing published datasets relating the
                   growth of plant stands (growth rate per land area) to
                   the diversity on the same plot. We use a global
                   dataset (Ellis et al. 2012 and MODIS-data, see Fig.
                   1), the grassland experiment in Jena (Buchmann et al.
                   2017), the regional study on forests in Romania and
                   Germany by Bouriaud et al. (2016), and data from the
                   German National Forest inventory (BWI 3, see Fig. 3).
                   In all cases the average response of growth to
                   changes in biodiversity as well as the boundary line
                   of the maximum values was calculated.ResultsIn both
                   vegetation types a decreasing trend of maximum
                   productivity with any added species emerges,
                   contrasting the average trend that was positive in
                   grassland, but absent in forests. The trend of
                   maximum values was non-significant in grasslands
                   probably due to the fact that not all combinations of
                   species mixtures were available. In temperate
                   forests, maximum productivity decreases significantly
                   by about 10\% in regional studies and by 8\% at
                   national scale with each added species. Maximum
                   biomass per area was the same for managed and
                   unmanaged conditions. A global assessment of NPP and
                   biodiversity could also not confirm a general
                   positive biodiversity-productivity
                   relationship.ConclusionsManaged grasslands and
                   forests reach highest productivity and volumes at low
                   diversity. Also globally we could not confirm a
                   biodiversity effect on productivity. Despite this,
                   for long-living organisms, such as trees, the
                   incentive for land managers exists to reduce the risk
                   of failure due to climate extremes and diseases by
                   taking a loss in productivity into account and to
                   actively maintain a mixture of species.},

                   its influence on ecosystem functioning. We compared
                   whether wood production in forests was associated
                   with tree functional group identity (i.e. deciduous,
                   conifer or sclerophylous), tree species richness
                   (1\textendash\textdaggerdbl{} 5) and tree functional
                   group richness (1\textendash{}3) by comparing more
                   than 5000 permanent plots distributed across
                   Catalonia (NE Spain). Deciduous forests were more
                   productive than coniferous and sclerophylous forests.
                   Wood production increased with tree species richness.
                   However, functional group richness increased wood
                   production only in sclerophylous forests. When other
                   forest structure, environmental variables and
                   management practices were included in the analysis,
                   tree functional group identity and species richness
                   still remained significant, while functional species
                   richness did not. Our survey indicates that across a
                   regional scale, and across a broad range of
                   environmental conditions, a significant positive
                   association exists between local tree species

                   relationship (SRPR) is both theoretically important
                   and contentious. In an effort to distill general
                   patterns, ecologists have undertaken meta-analyses,
                   within which each SRPR data set is first classified
                   into one of five alternative forms: positive, humped
                   (unimodal), negative, U-shaped (unimodal), and no
                   relationship. Herein, I first provide a critique of
                   this approach, based on 68 plant data sets/ studies
                   used in three meta-analyses published in Ecology. The
                   meta-analyses are shown to have resulted in highly
                   divergent outcomes, inconsistent and often highly
                   inappropriate classification of data sets, and the
                   introduction and multiplication of errors from one
                   meta- analysis to the next. I therefore call on the
                   ecological community at large to adopt a far more
                   rigorous and critical attitude to the use of
                   meta-analysis. Second, I develop the argument that
                   the literature on the SRPR continues to be bedeviled
                   by a common failing to appreciate the fundamental
                   importance of the scale of analysis, beginning with
                   the confusion evident between concepts of grain,
                   focus, and extent. I postulate that variation in the
                   form of the SRPR at fine scales of analysis owes much
                   to artifacts of the sampling regime adopted. An
                   improved understanding may emerge from combining
                   sampling theory with an understanding of the factors
                   controlling the form of species abundance
                   distributions and species accumulation curves.},

                   life, and the most extraordinary feature of life is
                   its diversity. Approximately 9 million types of
                   plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the
                   Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago,
                   at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the
                   world's nations declared that human actions were
                   dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating
                   genes, species and biological traits at an alarming
                   rate. This observation led to the question of how
                   such loss of biological diversity will alter the
                   functioning of ecosystems and their ability to
                   provide society with the goods and services needed to
                   prosper.},
