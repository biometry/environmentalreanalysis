A lot of stuff gets published that merrits a second thought: how exactly did they do that? What happens if they do this thing differently? Oh, that is a dodgy source; what happens if it is changed to a different one?

Happily we are moving into a time where almost all higher-quality journals demand the data underlying an analysis to be made publicly available. Often the authors also share their code, since they are sure to have done the right thing (and I think we should assume so, too).

So, with the data at hand, we can re-analyse those parts of a publication that are only computational, and alter some things we may want to explore the effects of. This is a repository for such re-analyses, run as part of our Master in Environmental Science, major Environmental Modelling and Data Science, at the University of Freiburg.

The format should always be the same: a two-page comment on the original publication, alongside a long, documented re-analysis workflow, alongside data and code.
